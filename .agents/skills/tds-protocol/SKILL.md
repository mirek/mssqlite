## Implementation — @mssqlite/tds

This spec is implemented in [`packages/tds`](../../../packages/tds)
(tests assert exact bytes from [examples.md](examples.md)):

| Spec area | Module |
|---|---|
| Packet header, splitting, reassembly | `packet.ts`, `message.ts` |
| MARS Session Multiplex Protocol framing | `smp.ts` |
| PreLogin request/response and encryption negotiation | `prelogin.ts` |
| Login7 + password descrambling + FeatureExt | `login7.ts` |
| SQL-login authentication + generic 18456 failure | `server/authentication.ts`, `server/connection.ts` |
| ALL_HEADERS, SQL batch, RPC, transaction manager | `all-headers.ts`, `sql-batch.ts`, `rpc.ts`, `transaction-manager.ts` |
| BulkLoadBCP COLMETADATA/ROW/DONE stream | `bulk-load.ts` |
| TYPE_INFO + TYPE_VARBYTE values incl. PLP | `type-info.ts`, `value.ts` |
| Collation, GUID, decimal, date/time wire formats | `collation.ts`, `guid.ts`, `decimal.ts`, `date-time.ts` |
| Server tokens (COLMETADATA, ROW, DONE*, ERROR/INFO, LOGINACK, ENVCHANGE, RETURNSTATUS, RETURNVALUE, FEATUREEXTACK) | `token/*` |

The live differential packet/token trace records an open ORDER-token gap for
ordered result sets; see
[`todo/order-token-fidelity.md`](../../../todo/order-token-fidelity.md).

### Notes discovered implementing

- mssqlite implements the full-session TDS 7.x encryption matrix, not
  login-only encryption. TLS handshake records remain PRELOGIN-wrapped until
  the final server record has drained; Node's server-side `secure` event can
  fire just before that write, so switching to raw records in the event handler
  loses the client at the framing boundary.
- MARS is negotiated only when the client requests PRELOGIN MARS=1. LOGIN7 and
  its response remain ordinary TDS; SMP begins with client SYN afterward.
  SMP's 16-byte header is entirely little-endian after signature `0x53`; the
  first DATA sequence is 1, SYN is 0, and FIN reuses the last DATA sequence.
  Each DATA frame carries exactly one complete TDS packet. The server starts
  with four-packet credit, advertises `receiveSequence + 4`, acknowledges near
  the window edge, rejects backward windows/out-of-order DATA, and schedules
  eligible response packets round-robin across SIDs.
- Password authentication is applied only after full LOGIN7 decode and before
  session/database allocation. Required TLS protects the descrambled secret;
  uniform 18456/state 1 failures close the connection after ERROR + DONE_ERROR.
- Bulk load packet type 7 is selected for fragment streaming in `Message.push`:
  complete packets bypass whole-message reassembly, while `BulkLoad.push`
  retains at most one incomplete token (capped at 16 MiB), emits complete rows,
  rejects NBCROW and hostile lengths, and requires a final DONE exactly at EOM
  by default. Server compatibility mode accepts FreeTDS/freebcp's observed
  row-boundary EOM without a client DONE; incomplete rows still fail.
  An IGNORE-terminated request receives a normal completion because clients
  canceling before message completion do not necessarily send Attention.
- Attention after request EOM is a distinct path. Finish/discard the active
  request response first, then send the acknowledgement as a separate tabular
  response containing exactly `FD 20 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00`
  (DONE + DONE_ATTN, command/count zero). `tedious` is already reading the
  original response when it enters SentAttention and waits for the next message;
  combining the acknowledgement with the original response causes its cancel
  timer to expire.
- **RPC OptionFlags is 2 bytes** (USHORT). The example 4.8 prose lists a
  single `00` byte, but the packet length arithmetic (47 total) only
  works with two flag bytes.
- The COLMETADATA example labels flags `0x0020` as "Nullable"; per the
  flag table `0x0020` is `fComputed` and nullable is bit 0 — trust the
  bit table, clients don't validate these strictly.
- tedious addresses `sp_executesql` by **name**, not ProcID — servers
  must accept both `NameLenProcID` forms.
- RPC parameter TYPE_INFO must survive decoding as the engine variable's
  declared T-SQL type. Using only the decoded JS value loses data-type
  precedence (for example VarChar `'2'` compared with Int `2`) and can silently
  inherit SQLite's mixed-storage-class comparison.
- Clients tolerate a missing FEATUREEXTACK even when Login7 carried
  FeatureExt options.
- money is genuinely split high-int32-then-low-uint32 — not a plain
  little-endian int64 (see §14).
- Time-only strings need parsing support in date/time codecs — `time(n)`
  values have no date part; MSSQL treats the implied date as 1900-01-01.
- DATETIMEOFFSETN carries UTC time/date followed by the original signed offset,
  not local time/date. Its 3/4/5-byte time rounds at the TYPE_INFO scale with
  date carry; decoding shifts UTC back to local for the canonical string.
  Keep all 100ns digits and validate local and UTC years without JS `Date`.
- DECIMAL/NUMERIC values cross the engine/TDS boundary as canonical
  fixed-scale strings. `decimal.ts` rounds to the TYPE_INFO scale, validates
  the declared precision before encoding, then emits the sign byte followed
  by little-endian unsigned magnitude; decode returns a string, never Number.
- DONE_COUNT is status bit `0x0010`. With NOCOUNT OFF, DONE/DONEINPROC carry
  that bit and the uint64 affected-row value; with NOCOUNT ON, the bit is clear
  and the field is zero. The token itself, MORE/FINAL and ERROR state, and final
  DONEPROC remain present. Visibility is captured per statement rather than
  inferred from the session after the batch finishes.
- Character TYPE_INFO collation bytes are derived from catalog names through
  `Collation.ofName`: LCID 0x0409, sensitivity flags for ignore-case/accent,
  version 2 for Latin1_General_100, sort id 52 for linguistic collations, and
  Binary2 flag/sort-id 0 for BIN2. The login ENVCHANGE remains the default
  SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS bytes.
- Fixed-width result metadata uses BIGCHAR (0xAF) and NCHAR (0xEF), distinct
  from BIGVARCHAR (0xA7) and NVARCHAR (0xE7). Unicode TYPE_INFO lengths are
  encoded in bytes, so nchar(n)/nvarchar(n) advertise 2n while values retain
  their character width.
- Proven non-null tinyint, smallint, int, and bigint result columns use fixed
  INT1/INT2/INT4/INT8 TYPE_INFO with no metadata or row-value length prefix.
  Nullable results continue to use width-specific INTN.
- FOR XML text mode uses the magic result-column name with NVARCHAR(MAX)
  TYPE_INFO and PLP values. FOR XML TYPE uses the unnamed XML TYPE_INFO and
  XML PLP codec. Both paths stream values beyond 8 KiB through ordinary
  COLMETADATA/ROW framing.
