## Implementation — @mssqlite/tsql + transpile + engine

The language pipeline lives in three packages:

- [`packages/tsql`](../../../packages/tsql) — lexer + parser to a typed
  AST. Its Readme lists the exact supported surface (queries with joins/
  CTEs/set ops/window OVER, full expression precedence and predicates,
  DML, DDL with constraints, DECLARE/SET, control flow, transactions,
  EXEC, THROW).
- [`packages/transpile`](../../../packages/transpile) — AST → SQLite SQL
  with function mapping and CONVERT style support.
- [`packages/engine`](../../../packages/engine) — interprets what SQLite
  cannot: variables, IF/WHILE, @@TRANCOUNT nesting, sp_executesql,
  SELECT INTO, error-number mapping. Its server-facing async execution checks
  an AbortSignal between statements and on every interpreted loop iteration;
  Attention is control flow, not a catchable T-SQL error.

### Parsing notes discovered implementing

- Reserved words must be rejected as bare identifiers (else
  `SELECT FROM` "succeeds" selecting a column named FROM) but allowed as
  function names directly before `(` — `LEFT(x, 1)`, `RIGHT(...)`.
- `TOP 10 *` is ambiguous with multiplication: binary-operator parsing
  must rewind when the right operand fails so `*` can be the select star.
  Bare `TOP n` only takes a constant; expressions require `TOP (expr)`.
- `CASE x WHEN …` vs `CASE WHEN …`: the optional operand parser must not
  swallow the `WHEN` keyword as a column reference.
- `GO` is a client-side batch separator — it never arrives over TDS and
  is deliberately not in the grammar.
- Statements separate on semicolons *or* juxtaposition; both appear in
  real client traffic.
- `@@ERROR` reads as the previous statement's error number — it resets
  *after* the statement referencing it, and it persists across batches.

### Implementation notes — later additions

- TRY/CATCH parses in `beginBlockOrTransaction` (BEGIN TRAN → BEGIN TRY →
  block, in that order); bodies terminate on the two-word `END TRY` /
  `END CATCH`, so nested plain `BEGIN … END` blocks parse through
  `statementRef` and never confuse the terminator scan.
- RAISERROR takes a parenthesized argument list plus optional
  `WITH option[, …]` (options parsed, lowercased, NOWAIT/LOG ignored).
- Batch execution classifies failures after each top-level statement.
  Constraint violations (515/547/2601/2627), conversion/arithmetic classes,
  RAISERROR severity 11-19, and cursor/sequence runtime errors emit an ERROR
  and continue; syntax/compile failures, explicit THROW, unsupported operations,
  and severity 20+ abort. `@@ERROR` exposes the immediately prior failure and
  `@@ROWCOUNT` is 0 after it. XACT_ABORT ON rolls back and aborts for qualifying
  runtime errors, but—as on SQL Server—does not change RAISERROR behavior.
  TRY/CATCH intercepts errors before this outer classification.
  Integer CAST/CONVERT truncates numeric/decimal inputs toward zero and treats
  empty or whitespace-only character input as zero. Other invalid text and type
  bounds retain 245/8115; TRY variants convert either failure to NULL.
- Integer `+ - * / %` uses checked evaluation: NULL propagates, integer division
  truncates toward zero, zero divisors raise 8134, and inferred int/bigint bounds
  raise 8115. SUM defaults to SQL Server's int-width accumulator; explicitly
  casting its argument to BIGINT selects a 64-bit accumulator. Both ARITHABORT
  OFF and ANSI_WARNINGS OFF are required to turn an arithmetic failure into NULL;
  otherwise the error is catchable and honors XACT_ABORT. Integer AVG shares
  the checked accumulator, truncates the quotient toward zero, ignores NULLs,
  and retains int/bigint result width; COUNT_BIG always retains bigint metadata.
  DECIMAL/NUMERIC uses
  fixed-scale strings with scaled-BigInt casts and arithmetic, SQL Server
  operator precision/scale formulas (including the precision-38 reduction
  rules), half-away-from-zero rounding, and 8115/8134 errors.
- Mixed known types use the SQL Server precedence table before evaluation.
  Arithmetic, comparisons, BETWEEN, IN, simple and result CASE, set operations,
  multi-row VALUES, and DML/MERGE target assignments share that coercion path.
  Declared columns, variables, procedure parameters, and RPC TYPE_INFO all
  participate; invalid conversions preserve 245/241/8114/8169/8115 and
  incompatible pairs raise 206/402 instead of inheriting SQLite affinity.
- String boundary functions use dedicated UDFs where SQLite differs:
  SUBSTRING starts before one by shortening the returned prefix, negative
  LEFT/RIGHT/SUBSTRING lengths raise 536, negative REPLICATE/SPACE counts
  return NULL, and QUOTENAME accepts the documented delimiter pairs, doubles
  closing delimiters, and returns NULL for input longer than 128 characters.
- Under every currently supported non-SC collation, LEN, UNICODE, NCHAR,
  SUBSTRING, LEFT, RIGHT, STUFF, and REVERSE count or manipulate UTF-16 code
  units. Supplementary characters therefore count as two; NCHAR accepts one
  0-65535 unit; and boundary results may contain an unpaired surrogate. A future
  implemented `_SC` collation must switch these operations to code points.
- LIKE uses the effective or default SQL collation for literals, columns,
  variables, parameters, and computed expressions. Its matcher implements `%`,
  `_`, `[abc]`, `[a-c]`, `[^...]`, literal `[`, and ESCAPE; invalid ranges and
  malformed classes miss, while a multi-character ESCAPE raises 506.
- Character declarations default an omitted width to 1; CAST/CONVERT default
  it to 30. Explicit char/varchar/nchar/nvarchar conversions truncate and
  fixed-width families pad, while assignment into table storage rejects
  encoded overflow with error 2628. ISNULL retains its first argument's
  family and width; COALESCE follows character precedence and widens.
- SET NOCOUNT takes effect at statement execution time: ON suppresses the
  affected-row value in TDS DONE-family tokens but does not change execution or
  `@@ROWCOUNT`. A nested procedure, trigger, or dynamic batch inherits the
  caller's setting and restores it on exit; changes within that scope govern
  each completion produced there.
- Built-in system procedures use the same EXEC/RPC path as user procedures.
  Argument binding accepts positional, named, and DEFAULT values and dispatches
  the final name component case-insensitively. The implemented administration
  surface is `sp_help`, `sp_helptext`, `sp_columns`, `sp_tables`, `sp_who`,
  `sp_helpdb`, `sp_spaceused`, and `sp_rename`. Metadata procedures return
  explicitly typed SQL Server/ODBC schemas instead of relying on SQLite
  inference. `sp_rename` does not rewrite module text or dependent references,
  and function renames remain unsupported because runtime function registration
  cannot be changed atomically with SQLite schema and catalog state.
- Computed column grammar is `name AS expression [PERSISTED [NOT NULL]]` with
  no declared type. mssqlite infers the result from referenced columns, casts,
  numeric precision/scale, and supported scalar expressions; PERSISTED maps to
  a STORED SQLite generated column and the default maps to VIRTUAL. Direct
  INSERT/UPDATE raises 271 and nondeterministic generated definitions raise
  4936. Generated columns may be indexed normally.
- Supported COLLATE names are `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS` and the
  `Latin1_General_100_{CI|CS}_{AS|AI}` plus `Latin1_General_100_BIN2` matrix.
  Column declarations govern predicates, ORDER BY, unique constraints and
  indexes; expression COLLATE has explicit precedence. CI folds Unicode case,
  AI removes canonical combining marks, AS retains accents, and BIN2 uses the
  unmodified text key. Unknown names raise 448 and conflicting implicit
  collations raise 468.
- CREATE [OR ALTER] PROC[EDURE] owns the rest of the batch as its body
  (MSSQL requires it to be alone in a batch); `parse()` patches the
  statement's `definition` with the trimmed batch source for
  sys.sql_modules. Parameters accept optional parens, defaults,
  OUT/OUTPUT and READONLY.
- CREATE/ALTER/CREATE OR ALTER TRIGGER also owns the rest of its batch.
  The AST retains the table target, AFTER/FOR or INSTEAD OF timing, ordered
  INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE event list, WITH options, NOT FOR REPLICATION, and body;
  DROP TRIGGER supports IF EXISTS and multiple names. Runtime transition
  tables are statement-level and read-only. Direct recursion is suppressed;
  nested triggers otherwise share the 32-level procedure/function limit.
- Named DECLARE CURSOR accepts LOCAL/GLOBAL, FORWARD_ONLY/SCROLL,
  STATIC/KEYSET/DYNAMIC/FAST_FORWARD, READ_ONLY/SCROLL_LOCKS/OPTIMISTIC,
  TYPE_WARNING and INSENSITIVE options plus optional FOR UPDATE metadata.
  OPEN materializes a read-only static snapshot for every declared type;
  FETCH supports NEXT/PRIOR/FIRST/LAST/ABSOLUTE/RELATIVE, either returning one
  row or assigning an equal-width INTO list, and updates session-global
  `@@FETCH_STATUS` (0 or -1; -2 cannot occur for snapshots). Plain,
  FORWARD_ONLY, and FAST_FORWARD cursors allow NEXT only; DYNAMIC rejects
  ABSOLUTE. LOCAL cursors clean up at batch/procedure/trigger scope exit,
  while GLOBAL (the default) persists until DEALLOCATE. Cursor variables,
  positioned UPDATE/DELETE, and live KEYSET/DYNAMIC behavior remain deferred.
- CREATE DATABASE, DROP DATABASE [IF EXISTS], ALTER DATABASE ... MODIFY NAME,
  and ALTER DATABASE ... SET READ_ONLY/READ_WRITE have dedicated AST nodes.
  USE switches database-owned storage and catalogs rather than changing only a
  label. Three-part object names retain the database component for attachment
  resolution; four-part linked-server names remain unsupported.
- CREATE/ALTER/DROP SEQUENCE parse integer types, START/RESTART, signed
  INCREMENT, MINVALUE/MAXVALUE (and NO forms), CYCLE and CACHE options in any
  order. NEXT VALUE FOR is a scalar AST node and uses a database-scoped generator;
  values persist across restart and remain consumed after rollback. Ascending
  sequences default to the type minimum, descending to the type maximum, and a
  cycle wraps to the configured/type minimum or maximum rather than START.
  Tinyint/smallint/int/bigint and decimal/numeric scale 0 (precision <= 18) are
  supported. OVER ordering, SQL Server's context restrictions, duplicate
  same-sequence coalescing within one result row, and sp_sequence_get_range are
  deferred; CACHE is retained in metadata but every completed statement flushes.
- ROWVERSION and its deprecated TIMESTAMP synonym declare the single automatic
  version column allowed per table. It takes no length, DEFAULT, IDENTITY,
  COLLATE, or ROWGUIDCOL clause. INSERT may omit it or name
  it with DEFAULT; explicit values raise 273, and any UPDATE assignment raises
  272. Every inserted or updated row receives a new database-wide big-endian
  binary(8), including no-op updates; nullable declarations still auto-generate
  values but expose varbinary(8) metadata. Values remain consumed after rollback,
  survive restart, span tables/table variables/sessions, and `@@DBTS` returns
  the latest allocated value without advancing it.
- TOP parses `PERCENT` and `WITH TIES` (`top.withTies`); UPDATE/DELETE
  accept `TOP (expr)` only, per MSSQL.
- OUTPUT clause (`Ast.Output`) sits between the column list / SET list /
  target and the source / FROM / WHERE. Items reuse the select-item shape
  minus variable assignment; `OUTPUT` being a reserved word is what stops
  the preceding expression (last SET value, INSERT column list) from
  swallowing it. INSERT/DELETE (and inserted-only UPDATE) transpile to
  SQLite `RETURNING` with the pseudo-table qualifier stripped; UPDATE
  reading `deleted.` values is engine-interpreted via a temp-table
  snapshot joined to the post-update rows. Divergences: an unaliased
  `deleted.x, inserted.x` pair collapses to one result key (duplicate
  column names — known engine-wide limitation, alias them), and
  `UPDATE … FROM` combined with `OUTPUT deleted.` is rejected.
- `Ast.TableSource` has a first-class `values` form shared by ordinary FROM,
  joins/APPLY and MERGE USING. The parser requires its table alias and retains
  the optional column-alias list plus raw rows. Engine resolution rejects
  unnamed, duplicate, mismatched and unequal-width columns with
  8155/8156/8158/8159/10709, resolves variables, and records the common
  SQL-precedence type and nullability for every column. Transpilation coerces
  the rows and wraps SQLite's native VALUES source in a stable named SELECT.
- MERGE parses in `parse/dml.ts`: USING accepts a table, `(SELECT …)` or
  the shared `(VALUES …)` source. `USING` had to
  join the reserved-word set or it parses as the target's alias. The
  parser requires MERGE's semicolon and reports 10713/15 when it is
  absent. Before snapshot construction, the engine rejects repeated actions
  with 10714/15 and a second MATCHED / BY SOURCE arm after an unconditional
  first arm with 5324/16. The same table can still be target and source (the
  snapshot makes it safe); multi-source matches for one target row raise
  8672. MERGE OUTPUT supports `$action` (lexed as a
  plain word — a leading `$` may start a word token), `inserted.` /
  `deleted.` items and stars, and `OUTPUT … INTO`; unlike SQL Server,
  source columns in MERGE OUTPUT are rejected (the row images are
  assembled after the arms apply, when source pairing is gone).
- `DECLARE @t TABLE (...)` reuses CREATE TABLE column/constraint members but
  requires the table variable to be the only declaration in that DECLARE.
  Object-position variables parse only in SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE. The
  engine gives each declaration a unique SQLite temp backing table and
  scopes it to the declaring batch or procedure; nested procedures and
  `sp_executesql` cannot see a caller's table variables. Backing tables are
  dropped on normal or exceptional scope exit.
- FROM table sources recognize function calls with aliases and positional
  column aliases. Implemented built-ins are `STRING_SPLIT(string, separator
  [, enable_ordinal])`, default/explicit-schema `OPENJSON(json [, path])
  [WITH (...)]`, and `GENERATE_SERIES(start, stop [, step])`. STRING_SPLIT
  requires constant 0/1/NULL for `enable_ordinal`, returns no rows for NULL
  or empty input, preserves empty interior tokens, and only promises source
  position through its bigint `ordinal` column. OPENJSON evaluates BIN2-like
  lax/strict root and WITH-column paths, retains exact AS JSON fragments, and
  reports SQL Server's distinct missing/wrong-kind/malformed error states.
- CROSS/OUTER APPLY parse as left-associative join nodes without ON. The
  transpiler supports correlated two-argument STRING_SPLIT and simple
  derived `SELECT TOP (1)` with equality correlations in WHERE. The latter
  rewrites to a partitioned row-number join; GROUP/HAVING/set operations,
  non-equality correlation, other correlated TVFs, and star projection over
  the rewritten source are cleanly unsupported.
- PIVOT/UNPIVOT parse as postfix table transforms with mandatory aliases.
  PIVOT supports SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX/COUNT over a value column and requires a
  statically known source schema; listed values become conditional aggregate
  columns while every other input column remains a grouping key. UNPIVOT
  expands listed columns in order, omits NULLs, preserves generated metadata,
  and rejects duplicate names or incompatible known input types.
- GROUP BY represents expression tuples, ROLLUP units, CUBE units, explicit
  GROUPING SETS, and `()` independently in the AST. ROLLUP expands from the
  full list to the empty prefix; CUBE uses all combinations; top-level items
  combine by Cartesian product; explicit duplicate sets are not deduplicated.
  GROUPING(expr) is valid for a grouped expression and returns tinyint 0 for
  an active key or 1 for a subtotal placeholder.
- FOR JSON PATH/AUTO is a SELECT-tail AST option. ROOT accepts an optional
  string (default `root`); INCLUDE_NULL_VALUES and WITHOUT_ARRAY_WRAPPER are
  flags and duplicate options are rejected. PATH dotted aliases create
  nested properties. AUTO requires FROM; current execution supports one
  source or a root plus one joined child alias. FOR XML remains deferred.
- CREATE/ALTER/CREATE OR ALTER FUNCTION parses typed/defaulted parameters and
  either a scalar RETURNS type with BEGIN/END statements or an inline
  `RETURNS TABLE AS RETURN (SELECT ...)` body. Scalar execution allows local
  scalar variables, SET/assignment SELECT, control flow, RETURN, defaults and
  recursion but rejects side-effecting statements with error 443. Inline TVF
  arguments (including DEFAULT) substitute structurally into the stored query.
- `INSERT BULK table (column type, ...) [WITH (...)]` is the wire-protocol
  setup statement generated by BCP/SqlBulkCopy. It is intentionally recognized
  before the general T-SQL parser by `engine/prepareBulkLoad`, because execution
  continues in a following TDS packet type 7 stream rather than in the SQL
  batch. This is distinct from the user-facing `BULK INSERT ... FROM file`
  statement, which remains outside the server's filesystem-free scope.

### Not yet implemented (raise clean errors)

WAITFOR, GOTO, BULK INSERT ... FROM file, source columns in MERGE OUTPUT,
FOR XML, COLLATE as expression operator,
AT TIME ZONE, ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN.

### Compatibility audit findings

The live TDS audit at commit `bcad53b` found additional semantic gaps now
tracked in [`todo/`](../../../todo). Unique constraints and explicit unique
indexes now treat repeated NULL-containing tuples as duplicates, preserving
collation keys and reporting 2627/2601 by origin. SELECT INTO still loses
expression types. IDENTITY allocation findings from that
audit are implemented with database-owned counters, custom signed definitions,
rollback gaps, session IDENTITY_INSERT, and trigger-aware scope. It also
confirmed general APPLY lowering; strict OPENJSON paths, VALUES-derived tables,
and the audited MERGE terminator and arm validation rules are now implemented.
Treat the individual
`todo/*.md` briefs as the executable scope and ground-truth checklist.
